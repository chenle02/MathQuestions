We want to build a website similar to mathoverflow.com to allow users to ask math questions and get answers from the community and leading AI models (using api calls). The website should have the following features:

User Registration and Login: Users should be able to register and log in to the website. They should be able to create a profile with their information.

Question Posting: Users should be able to post math questions. Each question should have a title, description, and tags (e.g., algebra, calculus, etc.).

User evaluation and reputation: Users should be able to evaluate answers provided by other users. Based on the evaluations, users should earn reputation points that reflect their expertise and contributions to the community.

Please make a plan for this project and break it down into manageable tasks.
