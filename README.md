 # Math Q&A Platform

 We want to build a website similar to mathoverflow.com to allow users to ask math questions and get answers from the community and leading AI models (using API calls).

 ## Features
 - User Registration and Login: Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
 - Question Posting: Users can post questions with a title, description, and tags (e.g., algebra, calculus).
 - Answer Posting and Evaluation: Community members can submit answers and vote or rate responses.
 - User Reputation: Contributors earn reputation points based on community evaluations.
 - AI Integration: Provide AI-generated draft answers via model API calls for review and refinement.

 ## Project Roadmap
 1. Project Setup
    - Initialize repository, select tech stack, configure CI/CD and development environment.
 2. Core Models & Persistence
    - Define User, Question, Answer, Evaluation, and Reputation models; set up migrations and database.
 3. Authentication & Authorization
    - Implement registration, login, email verification, password reset, and OAuth flows.
 4. Question & Answer CRUD
    - Develop APIs/UI for creating, editing, listing, tagging, searching, and paginating content.
 5. User Reputation & Evaluation
    - Build voting/rating system, prevent abuse, calculate and display reputation scores.
 6. AI Integration
    - Create API wrapper for AI models, generate draft answers, implement moderation/editor workflow.
 7. UI/UX & Frontend
    - Design responsive interfaces, build components for feeds, editors, and notifications.
 8. Testing & QA
    - Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests (e.g., Cypress) for key user flows.
 9. Deployment & Monitoring
    - Containerize (Docker), deploy to hosting platform, set up logging and monitoring.
10. Documentation & Future Roadmap
    - Publish API docs, architecture diagrams, and plan advanced features (LaTeX editor, badges, moderation tools).

 ## Next Steps
 - Finalize tech stack (e.g., Django + React or Flask + Next.js).
 - Scaffold the project and establish coding conventions.
 - Break down roadmap items into tickets or user stories for sprint planning.
